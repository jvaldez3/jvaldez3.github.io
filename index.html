    <p>The Siberian Husky is a medium size working dog breed that originated in Northeast Asia. The breed belongs to
        the Spitz genetic family. With proper training, they make great home pets and sled dogs. It is recognizable by
        its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings.</p>
    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Siberian Huskies were originally bred in Siberia, Russia for sledding.</li>
        <li>They made their American debut in 1909 in Alaska when they were brought over during the Nome gold rush to
            help with transportation.</li>
        <li>In 1925 a pack of Huskies saved a small town in Alaska from diphtheria â€“ a dangerous bacterial disease that
            affects the breathing. This pack traveled 674 miles in -23 degree weather to retrieve the antitoxin. The
            snow had become so dense that airplanes were not able to take off or land. This true story inspired the
            popular animated film, Balto.</li>
